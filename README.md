## 🧠 Purpose & Design Philosophy

> A portfolio shouldn’t just show what you’ve built — it should **demonstrate how you build**.

This site was created as both a personal branding platform and a technical showcase. Every UI choice, animation, and architectural decision was made with clarity and performance in mind. The minimal UI puts the spotlight on my work, while modern development practices ensure the site is future-ready.

---

## 🛠️ Development Notes

- Smooth animations via **Framer Motion** for transitions and hover states
- Projects and skills defined as **TypeScript constants** for easy scaling
- Focused on achieving 100+ scores in Lighthouse across all metrics

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

Building your own portfolio is humbling — you're the designer, the developer, and the stakeholder. This project helped me:

- Learn the **App Router** deeply with real-world use cases
- Understand the balance between aesthetics and accessibility
- Practice delivering a polished product with a tight scope
